After you obtain Csound and choose MIDI file enter this in command-line:
{{{
csound -o Output.wav -F Input.mid -T -d Drummer.orc
}}}
Generated sound will be written to Output.wav and rendering will be terminated when the end of MIDI file is reached.

You may also use additional options:
{{{
csound -o Output.wav -F Input.mid -T -d --omacro:Option=Value Drummer.orc 
}}}
