csDrummer: Record a drum session in a virtual studio
Copyright (C) 2008 Schlagg

csDrummer allows you to achieve same result as if you were recording a drum 
session in a real studio. Instruments are triggered by MIDI messages either
real-time or from MIDI file. An audio stream formed for each instrument is
routed to its own channel, thereby simulating a microphone record. Software
uses sound morphing technology for interpolation between two layers of an
instrument sampled with maximum and minimum hit force. This brings a much more
realistic effect than switching between a number of separate layers. Each hit
passes through humanizing filters which alter its force, morphing and time
offset. Theese filters give an effect of a real human playing a drum set.
